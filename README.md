# Taskmaster

## Python:

# Problem with programs that run once and quit (What?)

# Exit problems (Tied to below?)

# Sometimes, it seems, when trying to stop a process, the kill signal is
#	sent at a point during monitoring when the process hasn't started but
#	'active' is True. Setting the timer interval in "process_class.py" to
#	0.1 may give help as it is more accurate than 1.0 (every se√ücond)
